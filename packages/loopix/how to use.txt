These skycubes are made with Terragen.



How to insert the skycubes in 3d Gamestudio


copy this sript right after the "INCLUDES" in  the begining of your main-script:


sky cube 
{ 
type=<day_sky+6.tga>;  //the filename of the sky. change according to the sky you want 
layer=2; 
z=20;               //change this if the skycube is displayed too high or too low
material=mat_sky; 
flags=cube,visible; 
} 



Alternatively there is a skybox-model included. Eventual you will need this if you use "spehre engine" or if you want fog to display on the sky.


enjoy!
